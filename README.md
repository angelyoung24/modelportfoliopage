# SHANA

## Description
Shana (pronounced Shay-na) is a fictional hero protfolio website of a model done in CSS animations and JQuery. This is version 1 of the app.

## Roadmap
In other versions:
* The links to the pages will be clickable.
* The pages will rely less on CSS Animations as this is the hero page.
